<h1>Tamagotchi App</h1>
<p>A Tamagotchi app is a clone of popular 1990s virtual pet. 
  This app allows users to care for a virtual pet on their smartphones or digital devices,
  users must feed, play with, and attend to their virtual pets to keep  them happy and healthy.
</p>

<h2>Description of the App</h2>
<p>This is a Tamagotchi-style app for Android devices where users can take care of a virtual pet by feeding, cleaning, and playing with it.The app also includes features
to monitor the pet's health, hunger, and cleanliness status. This is created to teach people the importance of neutering pets and it also teaches kids responsebilty.
I used Kotlin to program my app because I thought it was the programming language best fit for this project. The app consists of two pages, first the welcome page to
greate user with a start button and a picture of the pet. The second page consists of three buttons the feed button, Clean button and a play button. When users clicks 
on the buttons the progressbars below will increase. I added three textViews to give a description of each progressbar so user can tell which button is connected to which 
progress bar. I faced alot of challanges coding this app but I managed to finish the app. The first challange I faced was add progressbars and getting them to run properly with no problems, the second challange I faced was connecting the buttons to the progressbars. In future I plan to change the progressbars into numbers and percentage so 
users can see the actual amount of happy or how hungery the pet is. I also want to Add more pictures and pages.</p>
